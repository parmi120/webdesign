# webdesign
the way in which my website came out was similair to what i had first pictured with minor differences, as some of the things i wanted to achieve was difficult.
my initial wireframe sketch is similar to my homepage but i learnt about adding social icons in the footer along with splitting it up into 2 sections which wasnt my goal at the start.
for my about page i was just going to keep it simple but then after i thought to myself i might make it a bit more personal and start to add my goals for the future along with adding some of my previous work.
the difference in having a vision and then implementing it is completly different through the use of designing mobile first it is hard to have all of the features you would like as you have to make sure they resize for each device aswell.
